# Hey, my name's Jack.

## I'm currently searching for a summer 2021 internship, so if you know of any opportunities feel free to [email me](mailto:jack@jackpalaia.com). Here's my [resume](https://jackpalaia.com/resume.pdf) if you want to take a look at it.  

I'm currently a sophomore CS major at Georgia Tech with concentrations in intelligence and info internetworks. Some of my academic interests include machine learning, quantitative finance, NLP, and competitive programming.

At Georgia Tech I'm involved in the GT Student Foundation investments committee, The Agency, GT Student Developer Club, and the competitive programming team.

Currently I'm interning at the Georgia Tech Foundation where I'm working on applying NLP and deep learning techniques to financial sentiment analysis.

Some of my interests outside of academics include weightlifting, stock trading, jazz drumming, chess, and golf.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jackpalaia) and [GitHub](https://github.com/jackpalaia), or you can [email me](mailto:jack@jackpalaia.com).
