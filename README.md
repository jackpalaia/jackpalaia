# Hey, my name's Jack.

## This summer I'm working at Amazon as a software development engineer (SDE) intern!

### This past spring I was working as a SWE intern at Dreambound, a startup based in San Francisco that pairs job-seekers with training programs to help them find employment.

I'm currently a sophomore CS major at Georgia Tech with concentrations in intelligence and info internetworks. Some of my academic interests include full-stack web development, computer networking, and high performance computing.

At Georgia Tech I'm involved in the GT Student Foundation investments committee, The Agency, GT Student Developer Club, and the competitive programming team.

Currently I'm interning at the Georgia Tech Foundation where I'm working on applying NLP and deep learning techniques to financial sentiment analysis.

Some of my interests outside of academics include weightlifting, stock trading, jazz drumming, chess, and golf.
