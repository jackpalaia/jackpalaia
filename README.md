# Hey, my name's Jack.

## This spring I'm working as a software engineer intern at Dreambound!

### Dreambound is a startup based in San Fransico that pairs job seekers with 3-14 week job training classes, finances their tuition, and then places them with employers immediatley upon completion.

### Some of our investors include [Union Square Ventures](https://usv.com), [Collaborative Fund](https://www.collaborativefund.com/), [8vc](https://www.8vc.com/), [Moxxie](https://www.moxxie.vc/), [RocNation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roc_Nation), and former leaders from Affirm, General Assembly, Twitter, and companies in educations and media.

I'm currently a sophomore CS major at Georgia Tech with concentrations in intelligence and info internetworks. Some of my academic interests include full-stack web development, computer networking, and high performance computing.

At Georgia Tech I'm involved in the GT Student Foundation investments committee, The Agency, GT Student Developer Club, and the competitive programming team.

Currently I'm interning at the Georgia Tech Foundation where I'm working on applying NLP and deep learning techniques to financial sentiment analysis.

Some of my interests outside of academics include weightlifting, stock trading, jazz drumming, chess, and golf.
